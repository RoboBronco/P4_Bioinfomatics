### Next steps:
1. Setup Git
	* If you're running Linux or OS X no worries. Git should already be install. To check run `git --version`. If you're running Windows then [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is your best choice.
	* Tell Git your name so your commits will be properly labeled `git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"`.
	* Tell Git the email address that will be associated with your Git commits `git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"`.

2. Clone this repo
	* With Git setup move into a directory of your choice and run `git clone https://github.com/BigCheeze45/P4_Bioinfomatics.git`.

3. Create your branch

	To keep the project clean and have one stable code base we should each have our own branch.
	1. `cd P4_Bioinfomatics`.
	2. `git branch <branch name>` creates a new branch (for consistency, we should just use our name).
	3. `git branch checkout <branch name>` switch to that branch.
	4. `git push origin <branch name>` pushes your local branch to the GitHub repo.

	To check if you branched correctly refresh the GitHub page and you should see the number of branches (below the repo description) change. If your branch doesn't show up [here](https://github.com/BigCheeze45/P4_Bioinfomatics/branches) then give it a shot again. [This page](https://github.com/BigCheeze45/P4_Bioinfomatics/branches) has a nice walk-through of branching a repo.
